= Avia Expert System =

== Description ==
This is a project which aims to create a simple expert system. Its purpose is to advice its user steps to reach the certain goal: take a flight to a different country's capital.

== Usage ==
The program is a JavaFX application written on Kotlin language, which will provide user with several choices to determine the user's situation and give him a correct course of action for a successful flight to his destination.

== Knowledge base ==
The expert system's knowledge base is predeclared as a text file in .json format. The knowledge representation model is a production model, stored as a list of entries, which contain following information:

1. The entry's id, which will be used to formalize logical rules and get the results.
2. The object name, with which the entry is associated.
3. The entry's property, which itself is an object, containing string of lexical description and a scoring mark for formalizing the entry's importance.

The logical rules are stored as a Kotlin Object, which holds functionality for generating a result, which will be presented to the user. It will be presented as a text, containing instructions and advice, based on user's input.

== Knowledge representation model ==

The following table shows the knowledge base's knowledge representation model, which formalizes the different properties of 10 objects influencing the trip.

== Logical rules ==

The following table shows the logical rules, which are used to generate the result for the user. If the user's situation matches the rule's condition, the rule's advice will be added to the expert system's return.
